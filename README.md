# Blum Core
## Game library background service

---

Blum Core is a cross-platform library management software designed to streamline game launching by unifying multiple app stores. Its architecture is highly versatile, as it does not include a built-in user interface, allowing even modest setups to choose a lightweight UI for optimal performance.

The software features a modern plugin system with a simple, concise API. Blum API makes creating integrations and extensions extremely easy, thanks to an architecture inspired by the Spring Framework.

## Currently, Blum Core is currently under development and not yet available for use.
